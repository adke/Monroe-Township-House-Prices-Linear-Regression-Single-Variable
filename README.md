# Monroe-Township-House-Prices-Linear-Regression-Single-Variable

### This project represents a linear-regression machine learning model that will predict the price of a house based on the area of the house in square foot. Training data has been provided and labelled as "homeprices.csv" when accessing the project folder. 

### Please ensure you have downloaded the correct dataset file as you will need to import this file into the Google Colab when running the code. Also make sure that you run the cells on Google Colab from Beginning to End. Otherwise, you will recieve an error at runtime. 

### For best user experience, ensure that multiple Google Colab tabs are not open as this project uses Google's virtual computer with limited RAM, Disk Storage, and GPU power on the cloud. This will not be a big problem for users with Colab Pro or Colab Pro + premium plans however, it is still recommended to minimize Colab tabs for optimal model performance.
